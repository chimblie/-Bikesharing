Bikesharing Analysis Report

1.	Overview of the analysis:
o	The purpose of this project is to help Kate and I explore the idea of a bike-sharing company in our hometown of Des Moines like the NYC Citibike program. The analysis we are going to do will help us predict if the bike-share company idea could work in Des Moines, Iowa.

2.	Results: 
o	To start our analysis, we decided to figure out how the bike-sharing business works in New York City. From there we may be able to prepare a business proposal on how it may work in Des Moines, Iowa.
o	We used the data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. Below are the images of all the analysis we have done and the explanation. We use Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes.
